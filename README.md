The goal of this assignment is to introduce OpenMP, MPI, and barrier synchronization concepts. You will implement several barriers using OpenMP and MPI, and synchronize between multiple threads and machines. You may work in groups of 2, and will document the individual contributions of each team member in your project write-up. (You may use Ed Discussion to help you find a partner.)

To get started, review the readme.md located in the attached zip file. Read the assignment description carefully before you begin.&nbsp;<strong>Start early</strong>, because you will be running performance experiments. You will need time to do the experiments and create a write-up after you finish coding. Most of the points for this assignment will come from the experiments and write-up, so you’ll want enough time to do a good job. Also, there are limited resources for running experiments and if everyone waits until the last week then there will be a lot of contention for these resources. (<strong>You are solely responsible for finishing on time – too much contention for experimental resources is not an excuse for a late submission, so start early!</strong>)

When you’re submitting the project, please make sure you adhere to the directory structure mentioned in the readme. Refer to this&nbsp;<a href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/m5qz2xsnjy-student-add-group-members">link</a>

<h1 id="project2barriersynchronizationalgorithms">Project 2: Barrier Synchronization Algorithms</h1>
Read this assignment description carefully before you begin. Start early, because you will be running performance experiments. You will need time to do the experiments and create a write-up after you finish coding. Most of the points for this assignment will come from the experiments and write-up, so you’ll want enough time to do a good job. Also, there are limited resources for running experiments and if everyone waits until the last week then there will be a lot of contention for these resources. (You are solely responsible for finishing on time – too much contention for experimental resources is not an excuse for a late submission, so start early!)

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
The goal of this assignment is to introduce OpenMP, MPI, and barrier synchronization concepts. You will implement several barriers using OpenMP and MPI, and synchronize between multiple threads and machines. You may work in groups of 2, and will document the individual contributions of each team member in your project write-up. (You may use Ed Discussion to help you find a partner.)

OpenMP allows you to run parallel algorithms on shared-memory multiprocessor/multicore machines. For this assignment you will implement two spin barriers using OpenMP. MPI allows you to run parallel algorithms on distributed memory systems, such as compute clusters or other distributed systems. You will implement two spin barriers using MPI. Finally, you will choose one of your OpenMP barrier implementations and one of your MPI barrier implementations and combine the two in an MPI-OpenMP combined program in order to synchronize between multiple cluster nodes that are each running multiple threads.

You will run experiments to evaluate the performance of your barrier implementations (information about compute resources for running experiments is in a later section). You will run your OpenMP barriers on an 8-way SMP (symmetric multi-processor) system, and your MPI and MPI-OpenMP combined experiments on a cluster of up to 24 nodes with 12 cores each.

Finally, you will create a write-up that explains what you did, presents your experimental results, and most importantly, analyzes your results to explain the trends and phenomena you see (some hints for analysis are given below).

<h2 id="detailedinstructions">Detailed Instructions</h2>
These instructions are presented in a sequential order. However, depending on how you decide to divide the work with your project partner, you may choose do so some of these things in parallel. That is okay, so long as everything gets done, and you say who did what in your write-up.

<h3 id="part1learnaboutopenmpandmpi">Part 1: Learn about OpenMP and MPI</h3>
The first thing you want to do is learn how to program, compile, and run OpenMP and MPI programs.

<h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>
Included with this project is a Vagrantfile which provides a VM with the required environment and installs.

Assuming you don’t have it installed already, download <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the latest version of Vagrant for your platform</a>. You’ll also need the latest version of VirtualBox, which can be found <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

Start the virtual machine using <code>vagrant up</code> and connect to it using <code>vagrant ssh</code>. Please note that Vagrant mounts the directory containing the Vagrantfile at <code>/vagrant</code>. Once you log into the VM, you can access the project files by changing your current directory via <code>cd /vagrant</code>. For more information, use <code>vagrant --help</code>.

<h4 id="openmp">OpenMP</h4>
You can compile and run OpenMP programs on any Linux machine that has libomp installed. You can try the example code in the assignment folder (examples/OpenMP). Additional informational resources are as follows:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openmp.org//" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenMP Website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.openmp.org/specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenMP Specification</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.openmp.org/uncategorized/tutorial-introduction-to-openmp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Introduction to OpenMP (video series)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLNL’s OpenMP Tutorial</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mpi">MPI</h4>
You can compile and run MPI programs on any Linux machine that has mpich installed (eg. the Vagrant box). Although MPI is normally used for performing computations across different network-connected machines, it will also run on a single machine. This setup can be used for developing and testing your project locally. You can try running the example code in the assignment folder (examples/MPI), as well as looking at the following informational resources:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MPI website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mpich.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MPICH website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.open-mpi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenMPI website (for general MPI API documentation)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part2developopenmpbarriers">Part 2: Develop OpenMP Barriers</h3>
Implement two spin barriers using OpenMP. You may choose any two spin barriers you like. For example, you could use ones from the MCS paper, anything covered in lecture, or any variation on these you think of. Obviously, your barrier implementations cannot use the built-in OpenMP barrier! However you can optionally use it as a third barrier in your experiments for baseline/control purposes, if you choose.

<h4 id="giventoyou">Given to you:</h4>
<ol>
<li>The barrier function interfaces are specified in <code>omp/gtmp.h</code> in the assignment folder. Don’t change the function signatures.</li>
<li>The <code>omp/harness.c</code> is a rudimentary test harness for you to test your implementation. Feel free to modify the harness to your needs.</li>
<li>You may run <code>make clean; make all</code> to generate the <code>omp1</code> and <code>omp2</code> binaries.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="whatyouneedtodo">What you need to do:</h4>
Complete the implementations of your 2 barriers in <code>omp/gtmp1.c</code> and <code>omp/gtmp2.c</code>

<h3 id="part3developmpibarriers">Part 3: Develop MPI Barriers</h3>
Implement two spin barriers using MPI. At least one of these implementations must be a tree-based barrier (if you choose to do both as tree-based barriers, that’s okay too). You may also opt for one of these implementations to use the same algorithm you chose for one of your OpenMP barriers, but the other one must be different. (However, even if you choose the same algorithm for one of them, you may find that you must implement it very differently when using MPI vs. using OpenMP). Obviously, your barrier implementations cannot use the built-in MPI barrier! However you can optionally use it as a third barrier in your experiments, as a baseline/control, if you choose.

<h4 id="giventoyou-1">Given to you:</h4>
<ol>
<li>The barrier function interfaces are specified in <code>mpi/gtmpi.h</code> in the assignment folder. Don’t change the function signature.</li>
<li>The <code>mpi/harness.c</code> is a rudimentary test harness for you to test your implementation. Feel free to modify the harness to your needs.</li>
<li>You may run <code>make clean; make all</code> to generate the <code>mpi1</code> and <code>mpi2</code> binaries.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="whatyouneedtodo-1">What you need to do:</h4>
Complete the implementations of your 2 barriers in <code>mpi/gtmpi1.c</code> and <code>mpi/gtmpi2.c</code>

<h3 id="part4developmpiopenmpcombinedbarrier">Part 4: Develop MPI-OpenMP Combined Barrier</h3>
Now choose one of the OpenMP barriers you implemented, and one of the MPI barriers you implemented. Combine them to create a barrier that synchronizes between multiple nodes that are each running multiple threads. You’ll also want to be sure to preserve your original code for the two barriers so that you can still run experiments on them separately. You can compare the performance of the combined barrier to your standalone MPI barrier. Note that you will need to run more than one MPI process per node in the standalone configuration to make a comparable configuration to one multithreaded MPI process per node in the combined configuration, so that total number of threads is the same when you compare.

<h4 id="giventoyou-2">Given to you:</h4>
You are given a template <code>combined/Makefile</code> which generates a binary named <code>combined</code> to test the combined barrier.

<h4 id="whatyouneedtodo-2">What you need to do:</h4>
Implement the combined barrier along with your own testing harness to generate a binary named “combined”. Please provide the appropriate <code>Makefile</code>. The invocation for the binary will be as follows:

<code>mpiexec.mpich -np &lt;num_proc&gt; ./combined &lt;num_threads&gt;</code>

<blockquote>Note that you are free to create your own harness for the combined barrier. The gradescope autograder will only test for compilation and run of the combined barrier.
</blockquote>
<h3 id="part5runexperiments">Part 5: Run Experiments</h3>
<ol>
<li>The next step is to do a performance evaluation of your barriers on a large cluster(<a href="https://pace.gatech.edu/pace-ice-instructional-cluster-environment-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PACE</a>). Information on how to use the cluster is described under <a href="#resources">Resources</a>.</li>
<li>You may need to modify/write the given test harnesses that runs some OpenMP threads or MPI processes and synchronizes the threads/processes using your barrier implementation. Then your test harness should measure the performance of your barriers in a manner similar to the MCS paper. You should look at the experiments in that paper again and think about how they were conducted.</li>
<li>You will measure your OpenMP barriers on a single cluster node, and scale the number of threads from 2 to 8.</li>
<li>You will measure your MPI barriers on multiple cluster nodes. You should scale from 2 to 12 MPI processes, one process per node.</li>
<li>You will measure your MPI-OpenMP combined barrier on multiple cluster nodes, scaling from 2 to 8 MPI processes running 2 to 12 OpenMP threads per process.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="somethingstothinkaboutinyourexperiments">Some things to think about in your experiments:</h4>
<ol>
<li>When scaling from X to Y of something, you don’t need to run every single number between X and Y. However, you should run one at X and one at Y, of course, and enough in between to see any interesting trends or phenomena that occur. You’ll have to decide at exactly what values you need to run the experiment in order to accomplish this. (Although if you have time and want to, you may run ever single number.)</li>
<li>You can use the gettimeofday() function to take timing measurements. See the man page for details about how to use it. You can also use some other method if you prefer, but explain in your write-up which measurement tool you used and why you chose it. Consider things like the accuracy of the measurement and the precision of the value returned.</li>
<li>If you’re trying to measure an operation that completes too fast for your measurement tool (i.e., if your tool is not precise enough), you can run that operation several times in a loop, measure the time to run the entire loop, and then divide by the number of iterations in the loop. This gives the average time for a single loop iteration. Think a moment about why that works, and how that increases the precision of your measurement.</li>
<li>Finally, once you’ve chosen a measurement tool, think a bit about how you will take that measurement. You want to be sure you measure the right things, and exclude the wrong things from the measurement. You also want to do something to account for variation in the results (so, for example, you probably don’t want to just measure once, but measure several times and take the average).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="part6writeup">Part 6: Write-Up</h3>
The last part is to create the write-up. This should a PDF file and it should include a minimum of the following:

<ol>
<li>The names of both team members</li>
<li>An introduction that provides an overview of what you did (do not assume the reader has already read this assignment description).</li>
<li>An explanation of how the work was divided between the team members (i.e., who did what)</li>
<li>A description of the barrier algorithms that you implemented. You do not need to go into as much implementation detail (with pseudocode and so forth) as the MCS paper did. However, you should include a good high-level description of each algorithm. You should not simply say that you implement algorithm X from the paper and refer the reader to the MCS paper for details.</li>
<li>An explanation of the experiments, including what experiments you ran, your experimental set-up, and your experimental methodology. Give thorough details. Do not assume the reader has already read this assignment description.</li>
<li>Your experimental results. DO present your data using graphs. DO NOT use tables of numbers when a graph would be better (Hint: a graph is usually better). DO NOT include all your raw data in the write-up. Compare both your OpenMP barriers. Compare both your MPI barriers. Present the results for your MPI-OpenMP barrier.</li>
<li>An analysis of your experimental results. You should explain why you got the results that you did (think about the algorithm details and the architecture of the machine on which you experimented). Explain any trends or interesting phenomena. If you see anything in your results that you did not expect, explain what you did expect to see and why your actual results are different. There should be at least a couple of interesting points per experiment. The key is not to explain only the what of your results, but the how and why as well.</li>
<li>A conclusion.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<ol>
<li>You will have access to the coc-ice PACE cluster for use with this project.</li>
<li>Note that you must <strong>not</strong> use the cluster for development. Develop all implementations (OpenMP, MPI, Combined OpenMP-MPI) using your local resource (e.g., a laptop) and make sure your code runs fine. After you have developed working implementations locally, you may use the cluster to run these implementations and gather results for your write-up.</li>
<li>Please refer to the <a href="./Cluster-HOWTO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Cluster-HOWTO</code></a> for details on using the PACE cluster.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="submissioninstructions">Submission Instructions</h2>
Submit the following to the Project 2 module in Gradescope:

<ol>
<li><code>project2.zip</code> – Please use the <code>collect_submission.py</code> script to create the submission zip file with the following format (once the zip is created, you may use <code>unzip -l</code> to inspect contents):
<pre><code>project2/
  omp/
    Makefile
    gtmp.h
    gtmp1.c
    gtmp2.c
    harness.c
  mpi/
    Makefile
    gtmpi.h
    gtmpi1.c
    gtmpi2.c
    harness.c
  combined/
    Makefile (generates the "combined" binary)
    *.c (all required sources)
    *.h (all required headers)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><code>Report.pdf</code> – Your write-up (as a single PDF file) that includes all the things listed above will be submitted to the same Gradescope module.</li>
</ol>
In addition, please note that the write-up will be an important part of the project grade. As such, it is a good idea to make sure you create a good write-up. The assignment description has some guidelines for the content of the write-up, but be thorough. Treating the guidelines like a set of checkmarks and doing the minimum to meet those checkmarks will not earn you full points. We expect students in a graduate-level course to do more than following a checkmark list. For an example of what a good write-up looks like, see the MCS paper itself. Although your paper does not need to be as long as the MCS paper (since you are only implementing a subset of the algorithms), it would still be a good idea to emulate its style and content to ensure success.
